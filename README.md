# metacity-themes

This project provides the standard Metacity themes that were once shipped 
with gnome-themes-standard and Metacity.

The aim is to maintain compatibility with the GTK+ 3 versions of Metacity
and Marco. The themes should work with other window managers that support
the Metacity theming standard, however these are not targeted.
